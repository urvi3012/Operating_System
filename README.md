This repository is full of basic programmes, for begineers to give a good try.
Most of the programmes are made in C/C++ and some of them are coded in both C++ and JAVA.
C++ is for interactive, user input programmes, while JAVA is to give user a sense of self executing, threads in a computer system, depicting light processes.
